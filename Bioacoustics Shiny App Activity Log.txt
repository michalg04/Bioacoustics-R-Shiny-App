Bioacoustics Shiny App Activity Log
Michal Golovanevsky 

Week 1:
	-Researched bioacoustics
		-What is a spectrogram?
		-What is an oscillogram?
		-What is a spectrum?
	-Watched the 7 video tutorial series on the Raven website and followed along using their 
	demo files 
	-Uploaded the .wav files in the repository into RavenLite and replicated the process shown 
	in the videos 
	-Compared some of the RavenLite results to our Shiny App and played around with 
	different files
	-Read through the R code and worked on understanding majority of the code
	-Researched bugs in the Shiny App and tried to ÒbreakÓ the App
		-New bugs observed: 
			-After uploading a file need if you click on one of the preloaded options 
			nothing happens, need to reset to change the file. 
	-Worked on fixing stylistic problems with the app
		-Made images in the help options align with text and adjust based on screen size
		-Researched font size/style problem
Week 2:
	- Began Researching audio playback
		- Got a working version of the app's playback on Google Chrome
		- Fixed font differences in the app
		- Published shinyapp to my own account
			-audio works everywhere but Safari browser
		- Researched how to get the wav files to play on RStudio webpage, potential solutions:
			-convert wav to mp3
			-if can't convert using R code, run a shell script to convert
			-use beepr() package
		
Week 3:
	- Worked on Audio Play starting and ending at a certain time
		- now it displays the time the audio is set to and is also synced with the spectrogram
		- it generates a new audio that is shorter rather than just move the curser so we can set an 
		end date as well
	- researched different segmentation or change detection methods
	- added a new tab for segmentation
		- using autodetec() from warbleR
			- a bit on the slower side
		- added Min/Max duration, amplitude threshold, and min/max frequency to the sidebar
		- added help buttons to explain each item on the sidebar
		- generates graph but doesn't always do a great job segmenting
		- good example is dolphin file with min time = 0.2 seconds
	- rounded numbers on slidebars 
	- made 2 red lines thicker/bolder
		- also added that to the spectrogram
 	- Made formula in text stand out more in overlapping help
 	- Changed "loosing" to "losing" in zero padding help

Week 4:
	- potentially fixed max db being 0
		- unsure of the lower limit (using alim)
		- need an example of when this happens
	- researched horizontal black lines on spectrogram to also add to spectrum
		- built-in feature for spectro, doesn't exist for spec, can make them artificially for both 
		but doing it just for spectrum won't match the spectro. Look at difference between the sin files
	- need more details for "Option to specify start time and duration instead of start time and end time"
	- Condensed inputs on left
		- made min/max pairs be on the same line
	- researched why doesn't it show amplitude for all frequences in dolphin file
		- potential solution would be to do a seperate if statement just for the dolphin files so there's no flim
	- fixed: "Choosing a different window function should change both the spectrum and the spectrogram, but it currently 		doesn't change the spectrum"
	- need more details: "Make pictures smaller and consistent across help options (use size of right graph in windowed 		signal as template)" 
	- fixed: f_s in sampling rate should be an actual subscript
	- Windows.R doesn't work when run by itself, why? 
Week 5:
	- worked on a few fixes with windows.R
		- still need to make the legend, but everything else is done
	- researched other spectrum methods
		- none worked in the way we wanted them to
	- new segmentation method using segment()
		- help buttons
		- downloadable datatable as csv
		- adjustment menu:
			- can adjust amplitude threshold and minimum duration of a segment
			- a lot of other options to explore
		- peaks/bursts data tables
		- information button for the segmentation method
Week 6:
	- segmentation:
		- removed bursts/peaks
		- start time, end time, duration
		- min and max frequency, peak frequency
			-using spec() graph and dfreq() for dominant frequency - peak frequency
		- investigated the range of amplitudes in the marine animals and why they appear to be in the -90 to -120 for 			  whales
			- used histograms to do that, documented in the Descriptive Stats for Segments issue
		- reproduced the spectrogram in the segmentation tab
		- added boxes around spectrogram for each segment
		- option to click on a segment in the data table and that will highlight a segment box in the spectrogram
Week 7:
	- segmentation:
		- added help buttons
		- fixed typos
		- improved the location of the graphs and their size
	- fixed windows help spectrum axis to only go to 0.4999
	- researched legend for 7th graph for windows.R
	- researched problems with noise file
		- works when run seperately outside the app
	- fixed noise file
		-removed NA value when picking min frequency
	- fixed dolphin spectrum
		- NAs were created in the sample rate, needed to round numbers
